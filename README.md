Productivity Board for Students

A productivity board designed for group projects for college students.  Students will be able to create an account to log into, and invite other students to different boards. Within a single board, students can create “cards” of to-do tasks that can be placed in different columns of the board (upcoming, currently doing, done, etc.). Each card will be assigned to one or more students, who then can mark it as done with checkmarks.  On a separate page, students can see an “agenda” with only their assigned cards/tasks.  On this agenda, one can also create “sticky notes” that are only visible by the single user. Student accounts also allow them to show their major, school year, and coding languages in a “bio”

Features to meet requirements:
Will be a public website that one can log into
Will create user-based accounts (possibly through auth0 using google accounts)
Through backend, will create/delete/update cards for each user
In the bio feature, interests can be auto-completed through most common entries
Backend will be dynamic as tasks are moved/finished
